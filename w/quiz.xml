<NAME><![CDATA[Directions for Questions 67 to 69 : The Passage given below is followed by a set of three questions.<p>Choose the most appropriate answer to each question.<p>The diffulties historians face in establishing cause-and effect relations in the history of human societies are broadly similar to the difficulties facing astronomers,climatologists,ecologists,evolutionary biologists,geologists,and palaeontologists.To varying degrees each of these fields is palgued by the impossibility of performing replicated,controlled,experimental interventions,the complexity arising from enormous number of variables, the resulting uniqueness of each system,the consequent impossibility of formulating universal laws,and the dufficulties of prediciting emergent properties and future behaviour.prediction in history,as in other historical sciences,is most feasibleon large spatial scales and over long times,when the unique features of millions of small-scale brief events become averaged out.Just as I could predict the sex ratio of the next 1,000 newborns bu not the sexes of my own two children,the historian can recognize factors that made inevitable the broad outcome of the colllision between American and Eurasian societies after 13,000 years of separate developments,bu not the outcome of the 1960 U.S presidential election.the details of which candidate said what during a single televised debate in October 1960 could have given the electoral victory to Nixon instead of to Kennedy.but no details of who said what could have blocked the European conquest of Native Americans.<br/>How can students of human history profit from the experience of scientists in other historical sciences?A methodology that has proved useful involves the comparative method and so-called natural expreiments.while neither astronomers studying galaxy formation nor human historians can manipulate their systems in controlled laboratory experiments,they bothe can take advantage of natural experiments,by comparing systems differing in the presence or absence (or in the strong or weak effect)of some putative causative factor.for example, epidemiologists,forbidden  to feed large amounts of salt to people experimentally, have still been albe to identify effects of high salt intake by comparing groups of humans who already differ greatly in their salt intake; and cultural anthropologists,unable to provide human groups experimentally with varying resource abundances for many centuries,still study long-term effects of resource aboundance on human societies by comapring recent Polynesian populations living on islands differing naturally in resource abundance.<p>The student of human history can draw on many more natural experiments than just comparisons among the five inhabited continests.Comparisons can also utilize lage islands that have developed complex societies in considerable degree of isolation (such as japan,Madagascar,Native American<br/>Hispaniola,New Guinea,Hawaii,and many others),as well as societies on hundreds of smaller islands and regional societies within each of the continents.Natural experiments in any field,whether in ecology or human history,are inherently open to potential methodological criticisms.Those include confounding effects of natural variantion in addional variables besides the one of interest,as well as problems in inferring chains of causation from observed correlations between variables.Such methodological problems have been discussed in great detail for some of the historical sciences.In particular,epidemiology,the science of drawing inferences abount human diseases by comparing groups of perople (oftern by retrospective historical studies),has for a long time successfully employed formalized procedures for dealing with problems similar to those facing historians of human societies.<p>In Short,I acknowledge that it is much more difficult to understand human history than to understand prolems in fields of science where history is unimportant and where fewer individual variables operate.Neverthless,successful methodologies for analyzing historical problems have been worked out in serverl fields.As a result the histories of dinosaurs, nebulae, and galciers are generally acknowledge to belong to fields of science rather than to the humanities. @@&& According to author, which of the following statements would be true?]]></NAME>

<NAME><![CDATA[Directions for Questions 75 to 78:   The passage given below is followed by a set of five <br/>questions. Choose most appropriate answer to each question.<br/><br/><p>When I was little, children were bought two kinds of ice cream, sold from those white wagons<br/>with canopies made of silvery metal: either the two-cent cone of the four-cent ice-cream pie.<br/>The two-cent cone was very small, in fact it could fit comfortably into a child's hand, and it was<br/>made by taking the ice cream from its container with a special scoop and piling it on the cone.<br/>Granny always suggested I eat only a part of the cone, then throw away the pointed end, because<br/>it had been touched by the vendor's hand (though that was the best part, nice and  crunchy, and it<br/>was regularly eaten in secret, after a pretence of discarding)<br/><br/><p>The four-cent pie was made by a special little machine, also silvery, which pressed two disks of<br/>sweet biscuit against a cylindrical section of ice cream. First you had to thrust your tongue into<br/>the gap between the biscuits until it touched the central nucleus of  ice cream; then, gradually,<br/>you ate the whole thing, the biscuit surface softening as they became soaked in the creamy nectar.<br/>Granny had no advice to given here: in theory the pies had been touched only by the machine; in<br/>practice, the vendor had held them in his hand while giving them to us, but it was impossible to <br/>isolate the contaminated area.<br/><br/><p>I was fascinated, however, by some of my peers, whose parents bought them not a four-cent pie<br/>but two two-cent cones. These privileged children advanced proudly with one cone in their right<br/>hand and one in their left; and expertly moving their head from side to side, they licked first one,<br/>then the other. This liturgy seemed to me so sumptuously enviable, that many times I asked to<br/>be allowed to celebrate it . In vain My elders were inflexible: a four-cent ice, yes; but two two-<br/>cent ones, absolutely no.<br/><br/><p>As anyone can see, neither mathematics nor economy nor dietetics justified this refusal. Nor did <br/>hygiene, assuming that in due course the tips of both cones were discarded. The pathetic, and<br/>obviously mendacious, justification was that a boy concerned with turning his eyes from one <br/>cone to the other was more inclined to stumble over stones, steps, or cracks in the pavement. I<br/>dimly sensed that there was more another secret justification, cruelly pedagogical, but I was unable to<br/>grasp it. <br/><br/><p>Today, citizen and victim of a consumer society, a civilization of excess and waste (which the <br/>society of the thirties was not), I realize that those dear and now departed elders were right. Two<br/>two-cent cones instead of one at four cents did not signify squandering, economically speaking,<br/>but symbolically they surely did. It was for this precise reason, that I yearned for them: because<br/>they ice creams suggested excess. And this was precisely why they were denied to me: because<br/>they looked indecent, an insult to poverty, a display of fictitious privilege, a boast of wealth.<br/>Only spoiled children ate two cones at once, those children who in fairy tales were rightly<br/>punished, as Pinocchio was when he rejected the skin and the stalk. And parents who <br/>encouraged this weakness, appropriate to little parvenus, were bringing up their children in the <br/>foolish theater of "I'd like to but I can't."

Choose<br/>the most appropriate answer to each question.<br/><br/>Fifteen years after communism was officially pronounced dead, its spectre seems once again to be haunting<br/>Europe. Last month. the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly voted to condemn the "crimes of<br/>totalitarian communist regimes." linking them with Nazism and complaining that communist parties are still<br/>"legal and active in some countries." Now Goran Lindblad. the conservative Swedish MP behind the<br/>resolution. wants to go further.
